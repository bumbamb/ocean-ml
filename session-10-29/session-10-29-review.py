# write a while loop that prints 1-12 


# Reviewing While loops:
# Write code to print multiples of 5 from 45 to 90
#i =45
#while i <91:
	#print(i)
	#i += 5

# With your partner: discuss: What is a set? What is it good for?
# Write your response as a comment here:
#an ordered group of things in python and there can be no duplicates

# Create a variable called "myset" and put whatever you want in it:
myset= {1,2,3,4,5}
